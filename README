The Double Description Method is an alogirthm to convert between the vertex (V-) representation and the half-space (H-) representation of a polyhedron. In a V-representation, a polyhedron is represented by its vertices (or extreme points), and in an H-representation, a polyhedron is represented by a set of linear inequalities (half-spaces). The DD method iteratively and systematically constructs the V-representation from the H-representation by considering each half-space (or inequality) one at a time and updating the set of vertices. At each step, new vertices are generated by intersecting the edges of the polyhedron with the new half-space. Also, the current set of vertices is checked, and if an existing vertex satisfies the new inequality, it is kept; otherwise, it is discarded.
